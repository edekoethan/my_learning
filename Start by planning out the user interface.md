Start by planning out the user interface for your web app. This will involve deciding on the layout and design of the page, as well as the specific input fields and buttons you want to include. You can use a pencil and paper or a digital design tool to sketch out your ideas and get a better idea of what the app will look like.

Create a new HTML file for your web app and use the <form> element to create a form that contains the input fields and buttons you want to include. You can use the <input> element to create the input fields, and the <button> element to create the submit buttons.

Use CSS to style your web app and make it look more attractive and user-friendly. You can use CSS selectors to target specific elements on the page, and apply styles such as fonts, colors, and layout properties to make the app look the way you want.

Add JavaScript code to implement the calculation logic for your web app. You can use the onclick event of the submit buttons to trigger a function that performs the calculation and displays the result to the user.

Test your web app by entering different values into the input fields and clicking the submit buttons to see if the calculation works as expected. If you encounter any errors or issues, use the JavaScript debugging tools in your web browser to identify and fix them.

Once your web app is working as expected, you can deploy it online so that others can access it through a web browser. This typically involves uploading your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web server, and providing a link that users can use to access the app.
